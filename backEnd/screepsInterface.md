Start by sending a request to auth/signin with your e-mail address and password in a JSON object in the POST data. The response JSON object contains a token (a hex string); remember that value. Each time you make a request that requires authentication (the leaderboard and terrain ones, at least, don't), send the most recent token value as both the X-Token and X-Username headers. The response will contain a new token value in the X-Token header with which you should replace your saved token. (You can send the token on every request and just check for a new one in the response, so you don't have to know exactly which calls require authentication.)

Example request parameters are given below, along with schemata for the server's responses.

Memory and console endpoints are from bzy-xyz.

You can access the PTR by changing screeps.com to screeps.com/ptr in all URLs.

Enumeration values
When an endpoint takes interval or statName as an argument, the valid values are the ones listed below.

interval: 8, 180, 1440 (8 for 1h, 180 for 24h and 1440 for 7 days)
statName: creepsLost, creepsProduced, energyConstruction, energyControl, energyCreeps, energyHarvested

post data: { room, x, y, name, color, secondaryColor }
response: { ok, result: { nModified, ok, upserted: [ { index, _id } ], n }, connection: { host, id, port } }
if the name is new, result.upserted[0]._id is the game id of the created flag
if not, this moves the flag and the response does not contain the id (but the id doesn't change)
connection looks like some internal MongoDB thing that is irrelevant to us
[POST] https://screeps.com/api/game/change-flag

post data: { _id, room, x, y }
response: { ok, result: { nModified, ok, n }, connection: { host, id, port } }

post data: { _id, room, name, intent }
response: { ok, result: { nModified, ok, upserted: [ { index, _id } ], n }, connection: { host, id, port } }
_id is the game id of the object to affect (except for destroying structures), room is the name of the room it's in
this method is used for a variety of actions, depending on the name and intent parameters
remove flag: name = "remove", intent = {}
destroy structure: _id = "room", name = "destroyStructure", intent = [ {id: <structure id>, roomName, <room name>, user: <user id>} ]
can destroy multiple structures at once
suicide creep: name = "suicide", intent = {id: <creep id>}
unclaim controller: name = "unclaim", intent = {id: <controller id>}
intent can be an empty object for suicide and unclaim, but the web interface sends the id in it, as described
remove construction site: name = "remove", intent = {}
[POST] https://screeps.com/api/game/set-notify-when-attacked

response: { ok, stats: { <room name>: { status, novice, own: { user, level }, <stat>: [ { user, value } ] } }, users: { <user's _id>: { _id, username, badge: { type, color1, color2, color3, param, flip } } } }
status and novice are as per the room-status call
level can be 0 to indicate a reserved room
[GET] https://screeps.com/room-history/shard0/E1N8/12340.json

{ timestamp, room, base, ticks: { <time>: <tick update object> } }
the number in the URL is the tick to retrieve information for (from 5e5 ticks ago to about 50 ticks ago)
note that the web interface only shows up to 3e5 ticks ago
the tick must be a multiple of 20; the response includes information for the 20 ticks starting then
for the first tick in the result, the tick update object maps from object ids to full object descriptions
for later ticks, the update includes only changed attributes
timestamp is milliseconds since the Unix epoch
